# Full-Investigation-of-Emerging-Caching-Policies
A C++ implementation and performance evaluation of four advanced caching policies: LFU, LIRS, ARC, and CACHEUS. The project compares these algorithms against varying storage workloads (MSR/SNIA traces) to analyze Hit Ratios and Dirty Page Evictions. Includes a simulation framework for validating recency vs. frequency trade-offs.
